Pipeline PythonNode

This python script will represent a single node of a pipeline.  It will be completely
driven via the following environment variables configured on the node properties
dialog of the pipeline:
- `NODE_FILENAME`: (Required) The filename associated with the node.  The extension
  is used to validate that the node matches the associated file.  The basename portion
  represents the node name - and is used in producing the output files.
- `INPUT_FILENAMES`: (Optional) A SEMI-COLON-separated list of filenames.  Each entry
  can include a _relative_ path as a prefix to the filename.  Each file is expected
  to exist and contain content.  The content will be printed and should appear in the
  out of a cell.
- `OUTPUT_FILENAMES`: (Optional) A SEMI-COLON-separated list of filenames.  Each entry
  can include a _relative_ path as a prefix to the filename.  Each file is NOT expected
  to exist, but will be created as a function of the notebook's execution.
