    "This notebook will represent a single node of a pipeline.  It will be completely driven via the following environment variables configured on the node properties dialog of the pipeline:\n",
    "- `NODE_FILENAME`: (Required) The filename associated with the node.  The extension is used to validate that the node matches the associated file.  The basename portion represents the node name - and is used in producing the output files.\n",
    "- `INPUT_FILENAMES`: (Optional) A SEMI-COLON-separated list of filenames.  Each entry can include a _relative_ path as a prefix to the filename.  Each file is expected to exist and contain content.  The content will be printed and should appear in the out of a cell.\n",
    "- `OUTPUT_FILENAMES`: (Optional) A SEMI-COLON-separated list of filenames.  Each entry can include a _relative_ path as a prefix to the filename.  Each file is NOT expected to exist, but will be created as a function of the notebook's execution."
