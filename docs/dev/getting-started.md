## Using the Elyra Pipeline Editor

<img src="https://github.com/elyra/community/blob/master/resources/github-homepage/AIW-1.gif" width="800">

* In the Jupyter Lab Launcher, click the `Pipeline Editor` Icon to create a new pipeline.
* On left side of the screen, navigate to your file browser, you should see a list of notebooks available.
* Drag each notebook, each representing a step in your pipeline, to the canvas. Repeat until all notebooks
needed for the pipeline are present.
* Define your notebook execution order by connecting them together to form a graph.

* Define the properties for each node / notebook in your pipeline

|Parameter   | Description  | Example |
|:---:|:------|:---:|
|Docker Image| The docker image you want to use to run your notebook |  `TensorFlow 2.0`   |
|Output Files|  A list of files generated by the notebook inside the image to be passed as inputs to the next step of the pipeline.  One file per line.  | `contributions.csv` |
|Env Vars| A list of environment variables to be set inside in the container.  One variable per line. |  `GITHUB_TOKEN = sometokentobeused` |
|File Dependencies|  A list of files to be passed from the `LOCAL` working environment into each respective step of the pipeline. Files should be in the same directory as the notebook it is associated with. One file per line. | `dependent-script.py` |

* Click on the `RUN` Icon and give your pipeline a name.
* Hit `OK` to start your pipeline.
* Use the link provided in the response to your experiment in Kubeflow. By default, Elyra will create the pipeline template for you as well as start an experiment and run.
## Using the Python Runner
<img src="https://github.com/elyra/community/blob/master/resources/github-homepage/AIW-4.gif" width="800">

* In the Jupyter Lab Launcher, click the `Python File` icon to create a new Python Script.
* When used in conjunction with `Jupyter Enterprise Gateway`, the dropdown will be populated with more kernel options,
allowing users to run their scripts with remote kernels with more specialized resources.
* To run your script locally, select the `python3` option in the dropdown menu, and click the `Run` icon.

## Integration with Jupyter Enterprise Gateway

Elyra integrates easily with `Jupyter Enterprise Gateway` allowing users to deploy remote kernels for more
resource-intensive development. Simply include the `--gateway-url` when starting `Elyra`

```bash
jupyter lab -gateway-url=http://<GATEWAY_HOST>:<PORT>
```
