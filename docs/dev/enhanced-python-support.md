# Elyra - Enhanced Python Support

Elyra provides **Enhanced Python Support** where Python scripts can be developed and
executed. It also leverages the **Hybrid Runtime Support** to enable running
these scripts in remote environments.

The execution of the python script leverages the available `Python based Kernels`. This enables
users to run their scripts in different configurations and environments.


## Python Editor related components

The Elyra python editor is based on the JupyterLab editor which is currently based on CodeMirror.
