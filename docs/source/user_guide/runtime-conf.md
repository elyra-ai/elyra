## Runtime Configuration

### Prerequisites
* A Kubeflow Pipelines Endpoint
* IBM Cloud Object Storage or other S3 Based Object Store (Optional)

### Configuring Runtime Metadata
**AI Pipelines** require configuring a pipeline runtime to enable its full potential. 
AI Pipelines currently only support `Kubeflow Pipelines` with plans to expand support for other runtimes
in the future.

To configure runtime metadata for `Kubeflow Pipelines` use the `elyra-metadata install runtimes` command providing appropriate options.  This command will create a json file in your local Jupyter Data directory under its `metadata/runtimes` subdirectories.  If not known, the Jupyter Data directory can be discovered by issuing a ```jupyter --data-dir```
command on your terminal.

Here's an example invocation of `elyra-metadata install runtimes --schema_name=kfp` to create runtime metadata for use by `Kubeflow Pipelines` corresponding to the example values in the table below. Following its invocation, a file containing the runtime metadata can be found in `[JUPYTER DATA DIR]/metadata/runtimes/my_kfp.json`.
```bash
elyra-metadata install runtimes --schema_name=kfp \
       --name=my_kfp \
       --display_name="My Kubeflow Pipeline Runtime" \
       --api_endpoint=https://kubernetes-service.ibm.com/pipeline \
       --cos_endpoint=http://minio-service.kubeflow:9000 \
       --cos_username=minio \
       --cos_password=minio123 \
       --cos_bucket=test-bucket
```
This produces the following content in `my_kfp.json`:
```json
{
    "display_name": "My Kubeflow Pipeline Runtime",
    "schema_name": "kfp",
    "metadata": {
        "api_endpoint": "https://kubernetes-service.ibm.com/pipeline",
        "cos_endpoint": "http://minio-service.kubeflow:9000",
        "cos_username": "minio",
        "cos_password": "minio123",
        "cos_bucket": "test-bucket"
    }
}
```
NOTE: In case of typing a custom bucket name using minio cloud storage, make sure the bucket name has no underscores

To validate your new configuration is available, run:
```bash
elyra-metadata list runtimes

Available metadata instances for runtimes (includes invalid):

Schema   Instance  Resource  
------   --------  -------- 
kfp      my_kfp    /Users/jdoe/Library/Jupyter/metadata/runtimes/my_kfp.json
```

Existing runtime metadata configurations can be removed via `elyra-metadata remove runtimes --name=[runtime]`:
```bash
elyra-metadata remove runtimes --name=my_kfp
```

`Elyra` depends on its runtime metadata to determine how to communicate with your KubeFlow Pipelines
Server and with your chosen Object Store to store artifacts.   

#### Parameters

##### api_endpoint
The KubeFlow Pipelines API Endpoint you wish to run your Pipeline.

Example: `https://kubernetes-service.ibm.com/pipeline`

##### cos_endpoint
This should be the URL address of your S3 Object Storage. If running an Object Storage Service within a kubernetes cluster (Minio), you can use the kubernetes local DNS address.

Example: `minio-service.kubeflow:9000`

##### cos_username
Username used to access the Object Store. SEE NOTE.

Example: `minio`

##### cos_password
Description: Password used to access the Object Store. SEE NOTE.

Example: `minio123`

##### cos_bucket
Name of the bucket you want your artifacts in. If the bucket doesn't exist, it will be created

Example: `test-bucket`

NOTE: If using IBM Cloud Object Storage, you must generate a set of [HMAC Credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/hmac?topic=cloud-object-storage-uhc-hmac-credentials-main) 
and grant that key at least [Writer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam-bucket-permissions) level privileges.
Your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` will be used as your `cos_username` and `cos_password` respectively, and
you should also add `cos_secure` as `"True"`.
