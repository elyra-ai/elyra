## Requirements and best practices for custom pipeline components

[Components](pipeline-components.md) are the fundamental building blocks of pipelines in Elyra. This document outlines requirements that user-provided custom components must meet to be compatible with the Visual Pipeline Editor. Best practices for generic components are documented in the [Best practices for file-based pipeline nodes](best-practices-file-based-nodes.md) topic.

### Kubeflow Pipelines components
