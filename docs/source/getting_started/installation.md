## Installation

The Elyra [JupyterLab extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html) can be installed from PyPI, conda, or from source code.

Note: JupyterLab currently requires a re-build after installing any extension.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

JupyterLab dependencies:
 - Elyra >= 2.0.0 requires JupyterLab 3.x
 - Elyra < 2.0.0 requires JupyterLab 2.x
 - Elyra == 0.10.x requires JupyterLab 1.x

The instructions below are installing the latest release.

### pip

If you use `pip`, install Elyra with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade elyra && jupyter lab build
```

Note: Ubuntu and CentOS users may need to use `pip3 install elyra` 

If desired, you can install these Elyra extensions independently:

- [Pipeline editor](https://pypi.org/project/elyra-pipeline-editor-extension/)

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade elyra-pipeline-editor-extension && jupyter lab build
   ```

- [Code snippets](https://pypi.org/project/elyra-code-snippet-extension/)

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade elyra-code-snippet-extension && jupyter lab build
   ```

- [Python script editor](https://pypi.org/project/elyra-python-editor-extension/)

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade elyra-python-editor-extension && jupyter lab build
   ```

**NOTE:** On November 2020, a new version of PIP (20.3) was released with a new, "2020" resolver. This resolver does not yet work with Elyra and might lead to errors in installation. In order to install Elyra, you need to either downgrade pip to version 20.2.4 `pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4` or, in case you use pip 20.3 (or later), you need to add option `--use-deprecated legacy-resolver` to your pip install command.


### conda

If you use `conda`, install Elyra with:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge elyra && jupyter lab build
```

or install the Pipeline editor, Code Snippet, or Python editor extensions individually:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge elyra-pipeline-editor-extension && jupyter lab build
```

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge elyra-code-snippet-extension && jupyter lab build
```

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge elyra-python-editor-extension && jupyter lab build
```

### Build from source

To build Elyra from source code follow the instructions in [developer guide](/developer_guide/development-workflow.md).

### Verify Installation

To verify an Elyra installation review the installed server extensions and lab extensions.

#### Verify the server extensions

Verify that the `elyra` extension is installed.

```bash
jupyter serverextension list
```

Should output:

```
config dir: /.../etc/jupyter
    jupyter_resource_usage  enabled 
    - Validating...
      jupyter_resource_usage  OK
    jupyterlab  enabled 
    - Validating...
      jupyterlab [version] OK
    nbdime  enabled 
    - Validating...
      nbdime [version] OK
```

```
jupyter server extension list
```

Should output:

```
Config dir: /.../.jupyter

Config dir: /.../etc/jupyter
    elyra enabled
    - Validating elyra...
      elyra [version] OK
    jupyter_lsp enabled
    - Validating jupyter_lsp...
      jupyter_lsp [version] OK
    jupyter_resource_usage enabled
    - Validating jupyter_resource_usage...
      jupyter_resource_usage  OK
    jupyterlab enabled
    - Validating jupyterlab...
      jupyterlab [version] OK
    jupyterlab_git enabled
    - Validating jupyterlab_git...
      jupyterlab_git [version] OK
    nbclassic enabled
    - Validating nbclassic...
      nbclassic  OK
    nbdime enabled
    - Validating nbdime...
      nbdime [version] OK

Config dir: /.../etc/jupyter
```

NOTE: If you don't see the Elyra server extension enabled, you may need to explicitly enable it with `jupyter server extension enable elyra`.

#### Verify the lab extensions

Verify that the `elyra` labextensions are installed.

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```

Should output:

```
JupyterLab [version]
/.../share/jupyter/labextensions
        @jupyter-server/resource-usage [version] enabled OK (python, jupyter-resource-usage)
        @krassowski/jupyterlab-lsp [version] enabled OK (python, jupyterlab_lsp)
        @jupyterlab/git [version] enabled OK (python, jupyterlab-git)

Other labextensions (built into JupyterLab)
   app dir: /.../share/jupyter/lab
        @elyra/code-snippet-extension [version] enabled OK
        @elyra/metadata-extension [version] enabled OK
        @elyra/pipeline-editor-extension [version] enabled OK
        @elyra/python-editor-extension [version] enabled OK
        @elyra/theme-extension [version] enabled OK
        nbdime-jupyterlab [version] enabled OK 
```

### Docker 

If you have Docker installed, you can use JupyterLab and Elyra by running one of the ready-to-run container images:

 - `elyra/elyra:latest` has the latest released version installed.
 - `elyra/elyra:x.y.z` has version `x.y.z` installed.
 - `elyra/elyra:dev` is automatically re-built each time a change is committed to the master branch.

#### Pulling Elyra container images

Images can be pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/elyra/tags) 

```
docker pull elyra/elyra:dev
```

or [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/elyra/elyra?tab=tags)

```
docker pull quay.io/elyra/elyra:dev
```

#### Running Elyra container images

Invocation example 1: Run the most recent Elyra development build in a Docker container. All changes are discarded when the Docker container is stopped.

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 elyra/elyra:dev jupyter lab --debug
```

Invocation example 2: Run the most recent Elyra development build in a Docker container and mount the existing local `$HOME/jupyter-notebooks/` directory as JupyterLab work directory. This enables you to make existing notebooks and other files available in the Docker container. Only files in this working directory are retained when the Docker container is stopped. 

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888\
 -v ${HOME}/jupyter-notebooks/:/home/jovyan/work\
 -w /home/jovyan/work\
 elyra/elyra:dev jupyter lab --debug
```

Invocation example 3: Same as above. In addition a local directory named `${HOME}/jupyter-data-dir` is mounted as the Jupyter data directory in the Docker container, storing all user-defined Elyra metadata artifacts you might create, such as code snippets, runtime configurations, or runtime images.

Note: To start with a clean environment `${HOME}/jupyter-data-dir` should refer to an empty directory. To re-use an existing Jupyter data directory from a local installation specify the output of `jupyter --data-dir` as directory name. 

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888\
 -v ${HOME}/jupyter-notebooks/:/home/jovyan/work\
 -w /home/jovyan/work\
 -v ${HOME}/jupyter-data-dir:/home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter\
 elyra/elyra:dev jupyter lab --debug
```

Open the displayed URL in your browser to start using JupyterLab and Elyra.

```
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://4d17829ecd4c:8888/?token=d690bde267ec75d6f88c64a39825f8b05b919dd084451f82
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=d690bde267ec75d6f88c64a39825f8b05b919dd084451f82
```


### Red Hat OpenShift

JupyterLab and Elyra are included in the Open Data Hub community operator. Follow the instructions in [this document](/recipes/deploying-elyra-with-opendatahub.md) to deploy the operator in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster.
