# Changelog

## v1.0.0rc0 (08/07/2020)

- Properly set pipeline version on new pipelines [#698](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/issues/698)
- Make pipeline process and export asynchronous [#695](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/issues/695)
- Use absolute form of export path when exporting pipelines [#690](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/issues/690)
- Validate pipeline and export submission dialogs [#684](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/issues/684)
- Create metadata editor [#589](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/issues/589)

Note: Pipeline nodes that currently do not list any dependencies but have 'Include Subdirectories' enabled, 
will not have the intended result. Instead, those node properties must be updated to include '\*' in the dependencies list.
However, use of '\*' with 'Include Subdirectories' is not recommended and finer grained dependency lists should be utilized.

Note: With the rename of the `python-runner` extension, we suggest uninstalling previous versions of Elyra before updating it.
