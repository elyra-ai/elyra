# Contributing to Elyra

Elyra is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community be it as code, documentation, scenarios, etc. 

Before you start, look at the project:
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/elyra-ai/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
- [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/elyra-ai/community/blob/master/contributing.md)

Also, for details on configuring your development environment, see:
- [Setting up your development environment](development-workflow.md)

## Elyra UI

Elyra runs as extensions to the Jupyter ecosystem, thus it's UI is currently implemented as
[JupyterLab widget extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html).

### Contributing to Elyra UI Extensions

#### Existing UI Extensions

The existing extensions are currently available as individual npm packages inside the
[packages](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/tree/master/packages) folder.

```
elyra
 -- packages
    -- code-snippet
    -- metadata
    -- metadata-common
    -- pipeline-editor
    -- python-editor
    -- r-editor
    -- script-editor
    -- services
    -- theme
    -- ui-components
```

#### File Naming and File Creation conventions
Elyra extensions use a separate file for each widget, and keep helper functions and classes in the file with that widget.
A file containing a widget is named after the widget (i.e. `PipelineEditorWidget.tsx` contains the class `PipelineEditorWidget`).

Files containing util functions are named generically after the utils functionality
(i.e. if a util function returned a custom dialog, the file that contained that function would be called `dialog.tsx`).

The index file contains only the definition of the extension class and any other exports that the extension creates.

#### Import sections conventions
Elyra extensions create separate sections for imports from different categories
(i.e. all imports from `@jupyterlab` would be in a separate section from imports from `@lumino`).
Sections are separated by a blank line. Each section is alphabetized by the name of packages.


### UI Tests
Elyra uses two types of frontend tests: integration tests (which use [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/))
and unit tests (which use [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)). 

#### UI Integration tests
Before running integration tests, docker needs to be installed and running on your machine.
There are two ways to run the integration tests:
* To only see the output logs from all of the integration tests,
run `make test-integration` from the root directory.
* To run or debug specific tests,
run `make test-integration-debug`. This will open an interactive UI tool for writing and debugging individual test files.

Elyra's integration tests automatically start JupyterLab and visit / interact with pages through cypress API calls.
The tests use the cypress API to check for the existence of various buttons and visual elements.
Refer to the [cypress API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html) for more details.

New integration tests can be added to `tests/integration`. 

#### UI Unit tests
To run all of the unit tests, use `make test-ui-unit` from the root directory. To run the unit tests for a specific Elyra package, simply run `jest` from that package's directory (under `packages/`). For writing tests, `jest` has a watch mode option: just run `jest --watch`. 

Elyra's unit tests test the various classes and objects used by Elyra extensions. Refer to the [jest API](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) for more details. 

To add unit tests for a package that doesn't have tests set up, some configuration files are required. In the directory for the package being tested, add a file titled `jest.config.js` that contains the following:
```
module.exports = require('../../testutils/jest.config');
```
Then, in the `package.json`, add the following under `'scripts'`:
```
"test": "jest",
"build:test": "tsc --build tsconfig.test.json",
```
And the following under `'dev_dependencies'`:
```
"@jupyterlab/testutils": "^1.0.0",
"@types/enzyme": "^3.10.5",
"@types/enzyme-adapter-react-16": "^1.0.6",
"@types/jest": "^23.3.11",
"enzyme": "^3.11.0",
"enzyme-adapter-react-16": "^1.15.3",
"install": "^0.13.0",
"jest": "^24.7.1",
"jest-raw-loader": "^1.0.1",
"ts-jest": "^24.0.2",
```
Create a file `tsconfig.test.json` that contains:
```
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfigbase.test",
  "include": ["src/*", "test/*"],
  "references": []
}
```

Finally, create a folder called `test` in the `src` directory of the package being tested, and add tests using the file extension `.spec.ts`.

## Elyra Backend

Elyra runs as extensions to the Jupyter ecosystem, thus it's backend is currently implemented as
[JupyterServer server extensions](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/extensions.html)
and exposed as REST APIs to frontend clients.


### Elyra backend services 

The existing services are currently available as individual python modules inside the
[elyra](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/tree/master/elyra) folder.

```
elyra
 -- packages
    -- airflow
    -- api
    -- cli
    -- contents
    -- kfp
    -- metadata
    -- pipeline
    -- templates
    -- util
```

### Backend tests
To run all server tests, use `make test-server` from the root directory. There are also two ways to run only specific backend tests:

* To run all tests in a specific directory or file, run `pytest [resource]` where `resource` is the relative path to a directory or file inside the [server tests](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/tree/master/elyra/tests) folder.
* To run specific tests by function name, run `pytest -k [test_function1 test_function2 ...]`


## Elyra documentation

The Elyra documentation's source is stored in the [Elyra repository](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/tree/master/docs) and hosted at [Elyra's Read the Docs](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/). The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html) and built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).


### Contributing to the Elyra documentation

To contribute content to the Elyra documentation follow these steps:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra).

2. Clone your fork.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/git-id-or-org/elyra
   ```

   The documentation assets are located in the `/docs` directory.

   - To add a new document create a new markdown file in the appropriate section subdirectory (e.g. `/docs/source/getting_started`) and add an entry to that section in `/docs/source/index.rst`.
   - To update an existing document edit the corresponding markdown file.
   - Place new or updated images in the `/docs/source/images` directory. For example, images for the _pipeline components_ topic in the _user guide_ are stored in `docs/source/images/user_guide/pipeline-components/`. `PNG` is the recommended format.

3. Build the documentation assets locally.

   In the repository's _root directory_ (not the `/docs` directory) run

   ```
   make docs
   ```

4. Review the build output and verify that your updates introduced no warnings or errors.

5. Review the updated documentation assets.
    1. Navigate to the `/docs/_build/html/` directory.
    1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

6. Commit your updates to a new branch and open a pull request.
