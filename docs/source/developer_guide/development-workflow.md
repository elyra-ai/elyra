## Development Workflow
This section describes the steps necessary to build Elyra in a development environment. 

### Building
Elyra is divided in two parts, a collection of Jupyter Notebook backend extensions,
and their respective JupyterLab UI extensions. Our JupyterLab extensions are located in our `packages`
directory. 

#### Requirements

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) 

#### Installation

```bash
make clean install
```

You can check that the notebook server extension was successful installed with:
```bash
jupyter serverextension list
```

You can check that the JupyterLab extension was successful installed with:
```bash
jupyter labextension list
```

### Incremental Development

Elyra supports incremental development using `--watch`. This allows you to make code changes to
front-end packages and see them without running `make install` again.

After installation run the following to watch for code changes and rebuild automatically:
```bash
make watch
```

Then in a separate terminal, using the same Python environment, start JupyterLab in watch mode:
```bash
jupyter lab --watch
```

When in watch mode JupyterLab will watch for changes in the build of each package and rebuild.
To see your changes just refresh JupyterLab in your browser.

> NOTE: JupyterLab watch mode will not pick up changes in package dependencies like `application`.
So when making changes to application you will need to stop and restart `jupyter lab --watch` and
not just refresh your browser.
