# Troubleshooting

This page identifies scenarios we've encountered when building/running Elyra.

- **Elyra build fails with: error An unexpected error occurred: "ENOTDIR: not a directory, scandir..."**

This happens due to yarn not being happy with additional `@` in the path structure. We have seen this when the
OS user has that symbol in its name (e.g. `user@domain.com`)

- **Install fails with: zsh: no matches found: elyra[all]**

This happens when trying to install Elyra via the Z Shell. The Z shell is the default shell on macOS versions of Catalina or later. Ensure that the argument is surrounded by single quotes as follows - this is not necessary when running on bash.
```
pip install --upgrade 'elyra[all]' && jupyter lab build
```
