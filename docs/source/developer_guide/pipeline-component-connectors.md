## How to develop a component catalog connector

Elyra uses connectors to retrieve [pipeline components](../user_guide/pipeline-components.md) from local or remote component catalogs.

![Components, connectors, and catalogs](../images/developer_guide/pipeline-component-connectors/component-catalogs.png)

The examples repository includes a [list of available catalog connectors](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/master/component-catalog-connectors) and instructions on [how to create a custom connector](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/master/component-catalog-connectors/build-a-custom-connector.md).
