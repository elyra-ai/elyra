# Deploying Elyra & JupyterHub in a Kubernetes environment

This document goes over how to integrate Elyra into a self-service Jupyter Notebook platform
managed by JupyterHub in a Kubernetes environment.

The links below provide more details on how to install/configure JupyterHub:
 - [Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
 - [Ansible script to deploy Elyra, JupyterHub, Jupyter Enterprise Gateway](https://github.com/lresende/ansible-kubernetes-cluster)

![JupyterHub Deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lresende/ansible-kubernetes-cluster/master/docs/images/elyra-deployment-diagram.png)

## Configuring JupyterHub Deployment

In this case, JupyterHub is the recommended entry point for Elyra, as it will manage the user
authorization and provisioning of individual Notebook servers for each user.

JupyterHub is configured via a config.yaml file, and the following settings are required:

 * Configure JupyterHub to use Elyra docker image when instantiating the notebook environment for each user

```yaml
singleuser:
  defaultUrl: "/lab"
  image:
    name: elyra/elyra
    # change to a specific release version as appropriate
    tag: dev
    # disable this in a production environment
    pullPolicy: "Always"
  storage:
    dynamic:
      storageClass: nfs-dynamic
```

## Deploying Jupyter Enterprise Gateway

Jupyter Enterprise Gateway enables support for remote kernels in a Jupyter Deployment

 * Deploying Jupyter Enterprise gateway

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/v2.1.1/etc/kubernetes/enterprise-gateway.yaml
```

## Connecting JupyterHub and Jupyter Enterprise Gateway

Now that all components are deployed, we need to make them aware of each other via some
additional environment variables.

 * Flowing current user from JupyterHub to Jupyter Enterprise Gateway

```yaml
hub:
  ...
  extraConfig: |-
    from kubespawner import KubeSpawner
    from tornado import gen
    import yaml

    class CustomKubeSpawner(KubeSpawner):
        def get_env(self):
            env = super().get_env()

            env['KERNEL_USERNAME'] =  self.user.name

            return env
    c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = CustomKubeSpawner
    c.Spawner.start_timeout = 500
```

  * Integrating Elyra (Jupyter Notebook) with Jupyter Enterprise Gateway

```yaml
singleuser:
  defaultUrl: "/lab"
  image:
    name: elyra/elyra
    # change to a specific release version as appropriated
    tag: dev
    # disable this in a production environment
    pullPolicy: "Always"
  storage:
    dynamic:
      storageClass: nfs-dynamic
  extraEnv:
    JUPYTER_GATEWAY_URL: <FQDN of Gateway Service Endpoint>
    JUPYTER_GATEWAY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: "120"
```

## Customizing the docker image to be used

We have created an [Elyra docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/elyra) with specific dependencies
required to run elyra, and that could be used to customize your environment with other additional
packages required by your workloads, or any other customizations needed.

```dockerfile
FROM elyra/elyra:dev

...


```
