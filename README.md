The [Elyra Getting Started Guide](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/overview.html)
includes more details on these features.

## Try Elyra

 You can try out some of Elyra features using the [My Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) service.

 Click on the link below to try Elyra, on a sandbox environment, without having to install anything.

Elyra can be installed via PyPi:

### Prerequisites :
* [NodeJS 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Python 3.X](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

##### Optional :
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) 

#### JupyterLab support

```
Note: Ubuntu and CentOS users may need to use `pip3 install elyra`

      jupyterlab_git 0.20.0 OK
    nbdime  enabled
    - Validating...
      nbdime 2.0.0 OK
```
```bash
jupyter labextension list
```
Should output:
```
Known labextensions:
   app dir: /.../share/jupyter/lab
        @elyra/code-snippet-extension v1.0.0-rc.1  enabled  OK*
        @elyra/metadata-editor-extension v1.0.0-rc.1  enabled  OK*
        @elyra/pipeline-editor-extension v1.0.0-rc.1  enabled  OK*

        @jupyterlab/toc v4.0.0  enabled  OK
        nbdime-jupyterlab v2.0.0  enabled  OK
```
NOTE: If you don't see the Elyra server extension enabled, you may need to explicitly enable
it with `jupyter serverextension enable elyra`

## Configuring Runtimes for Pipeline execution

The Elyra Pipeline editor delegates execution of pipelines to remote runtimes. Configure these
external runtimes as documented in
[Runtime Configuration](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/runtime-conf.html).

## Starting Elyra
After verifying Elyra has been installed, start Elyra with:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
