## Installation
Elyra can be installed via PyPi:

### Prerequisites :
* [NodeJS 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Python 3.X](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

##### Optional :
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) 

#### JupyterLab support

* [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) 1.x is supported on **Elyra 0.10.0 and below**
* [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) 2.x is supported on **Elyra 0.11.0-rc0 and above**

via PyPi:
```bash
pip install elyra && jupyter lab build
```
Note: Ubuntu and CentOS users may need to use `pip3 install elyra` 

### Verify Installation 
```bash
jupyter serverextension list
```
Should output:
```
config dir: /usr/local/etc/jupyter
    elyra  enabled
    - Validating...
      elyra 0.10.1 OK
    jupyterlab  enabled
    - Validating...
      jupyterlab 2.1.1 OK
    jupyterlab_git  enabled
    - Validating...
      jupyterlab_git 0.20.0rc0 OK
    nbdime  enabled
    - Validating...
      nbdime 2.0.0 OK

```
```bash
jupyter labextension list
```
Should output:
```
Known labextensions:
   app dir: /Users/lresende/opt/anaconda/envs/dev/share/jupyter/lab
        @elyra/application v0.11.0-dev  enabled  OK*
        @elyra/code-snippet-extension-experimental v0.11.0-dev  enabled  OK
        @elyra/notebook-scheduler-extension v0.11.0-dev  enabled  OK
        @elyra/pipeline-editor-extension v0.11.0-dev  enabled  OK

        @jupyterlab/git v0.20.0-rc.0  enabled  OK
        @jupyterlab/toc v3.0.0  enabled  OK
        nbdime-jupyterlab v2.0.0  enabled  OK
```
NOTE: If you don't see the elyra server extension enabled, you may need to explicitly enable
it with `jupyter serverextension enable elyra`

## Starting Elyra
After verifying Elyra has been installed, start Elyra with:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Development Workflow
### Building

`Elyra` is divided in two parts, a collection of Jupyter Notebook backend extensions,
and their respective JupyterLab UI extensions. Our JupyterLab extensions are located in our `packages`
directory. 

#### Requirements

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) 

#### Installation

```bash
make clean install
```

You can check that the notebook server extension was successful installed with:
```bash
jupyter serverextension list
```

You can check that the JupyterLab extension was successful installed with:
```bash
jupyter labextension list
```
