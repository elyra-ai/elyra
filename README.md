![Elyra](docs/source/images/readme/elyra-main-page.png)

The [Elyra Getting Started Guide](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/overview.html) includes more details on these features. A version-specific summary of new features is located on the [releases page](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/releases).

## Try Elyra

#### Using container images

You can also try Elyra by running one of the container images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/elyra/tags) or [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/elyra/elyra?tab=tags):
- `elyra/elyra:latest` has the latest released version installed.
- `elyra/elyra:x.y.z` has a specific version installed.

Note: You can also [build a container image from the `main` branch ("dev build")](https://github.com/elyra-ai/elyra/tree/main/etc/docker/elyra) to try out features that have not been released yet.  

To run one of the container images, issue the following command, specifying a tag of your choice.

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 elyra/elyra:dev jupyter lab --debug
```

To make a local directory containing your Notebooks (e.g. ${HOME}/opensource/jupyter-notebooks/) available in your
docker container, you can use a mount command similar to the following:

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${HOME}/opensource/jupyter-notebooks/:/home/jovyan/work -w /home/jovyan/work elyra/elyra:dev jupyter lab --debug
```

These should produce output similar to that below, where you can then find the URL to be used to access Elyra in your local browser.

```
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://4d17829ecd4c:8888/?token=d690bde267ec75d6f88c64a39825f8b05b919dd084451f82
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=d690bde267ec75d6f88c64a39825f8b05b919dd084451f82
```

Refer to the [installation documentation](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#docker) for details.

```bash
jupyter server extension list
```
Should output:
```
