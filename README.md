The [Elyra Getting Started Guide](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/overview.html)
includes more details on these features.

## Try Elyra

#### Using Binder
You can try out some of Elyra features using the [My Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) service.

Click on a link below to try Elyra, on a sandbox environment, without having to install anything.

- [![Launch latest stable version](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/elyra-ai/elyra/v1.5.3?urlpath=lab/tree/binder-demo) (Latest stable version - see [changelog](/docs/source/getting_started/changelog.md) for recent updates)
- [![Launch latest development version](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/elyra-ai/elyra/master?urlpath=lab/tree/binder-demo) (Development version - expect longer image load time due to just-in-time build)

#### Using Docker

You can also try Elyra by running one of the docker images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/elyra/tags):
- `elyra/elyra:latest` has the latest released version installed.
- `elyra/elyra:x.y.z` has a specific version installed.
- `elyra/elyra:dev` is automatically re-built each time a change is committed to the master branch.

The command below starts the most recent development build in a clean environment:

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 elyra/elyra:dev jupyter lab --debug
```

To make a local directory containing your Notebooks (e.g. ${HOME}/opensource/jupyter-notebooks/) available in your
docker container, you can use a mount command similar to the following:

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${HOME}/opensource/jupyter-notebooks/:/home/jovyan/work -w /home/jovyan/work elyra/elyra:dev jupyter lab --debug
```

These should produce output similar to that below, where you can then find the URL to be used
to access Elyra in your local browser.

```
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://4d17829ecd4c:8888/?token=d690bde267ec75d6f88c64a39825f8b05b919dd084451f82
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=d690bde267ec75d6f88c64a39825f8b05b919dd084451f82
```
